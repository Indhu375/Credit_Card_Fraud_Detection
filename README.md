🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution for credit card fraud detection, addressing the critical challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced datasets. The system employs various data preprocessing techniques, multiple machine learning algorithms, and comprehensive evaluation metrics to achieve optimal fraud detection performance.

Key Highlights:

🎯 High Precision & Recall for fraud detection

⚖️ Handles class imbalance using SMOTE and other techniques

📊 Comprehensive model evaluation with multiple metrics

🔍 Explainable AI with feature importance analysis

🚀 Production-ready pipeline implementation

📊 Dataset

Source : 

The project uses the popular Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, containing transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Features Description

V1-V28: Principal components obtained from PCA transformation (anonymized for privacy)

Time: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction

Amount: Transaction amount

Class: Target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate)

🛠 Features

🔧 Technical Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, outlier detection

Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical analysis, correlation studies, distribution visualization

Class Imbalance Handling: SMOTE, Random UnderSampling, class weights

Multiple Algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and more

Model Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix

📈 Model Performance
