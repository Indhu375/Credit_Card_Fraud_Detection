# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 🧾 Project Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **modeling** with  
algorithms like **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**.  

The project compares model performance using metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, **AUC**, and **Confusion Matrix** to identify the best model for fraud detection.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** (commonly found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)).  
It contains anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.  

- Total transactions: 284,807  
- Fraudulent transactions: 492  
- Legitimate transactions: 284,315  
- Features: 30 (V1–V28 are PCA-transformed features, plus Time, Amount, and Class)  
- Target variable:  
  - `0` → Legitimate transaction  
  - `1` → Fraudulent transaction
